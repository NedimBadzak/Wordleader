# Wordleader
Simple Android app made during the Wordle hype to help with word ideas. 
It is using the possible words wordlist from the official wordle website, so all words that are suggested are real solutions, 
even though many of them have already been solutions, so are not valid. 
The reason I didn't exclude existing solutions is because I don't want this to be a solver, but rather a dictionary search type of app.


## Sample usage:
Enter your favorite word in wordle and input the same word into the app with resulting colors (gray, yellow, green). It will then output all possible words.
On second word entry, it won't remember the previous "fails" but rather start over, since, again, this is not a solver, but rather a dictionary search.
